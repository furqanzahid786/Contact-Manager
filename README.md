# Contact-Manager

This React.js project serves as a contact manager, utilizing a combination of class components and functional components alongside React Hooks such as useState and useEffect to manage state and lifecycles effectively. Smooth navigation between different sections of the application is facilitated by React Router.

For structure and style, HTML and CSS are utilized, resulting in an interface that is visually appealing and user-friendly. Users have the capability to add contacts, including their name, email, and an associated image icon, with data passed between components using props.

Contacts are displayed with their details alongside image icons for easy identification. Additionally, the project allows for the deletion of contacts, empowering users with control over their contact list. 

Text conditions have been implemented to provide clear feedback throughout the interaction process.
